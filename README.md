# KeyPad
The code provided here uses C++ language to communicate with PIC16F887 microcontroller and aims at detecting a keypad button press. Upon detection, the user is free to chose what operation to do, here in this code the output is connected to a seven segment display so that the pressed key shows up on the display. The circuit kit is simulated using Proteus 8.1. You can use any IDE of your choice, I used MPLAB but any other PIC IDE would do the job.
